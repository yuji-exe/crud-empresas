Some features are not yet working or implemented

Business logic and entity modelling was made based on a video of a project that used other frameworks (link)

This project uses Spring, Vaadin and MySQL.

In order for it to run on your machine, you'll need java 17, a mysql server (modify properties to your ports, user and password)
